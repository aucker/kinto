![kinto-color-132](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10969616/94909977-9d2d4900-0469-11eb-8710-986289fe7240.gif)


[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/rbreaves/kinto.svg)](https://github.com/rbreaves/kinto/releases/latest)

\- Mac-style shortcut keys for Linux & Windows. \-

Seamless copy and paste with all apps and terminals. The zero effort solution.

v1.2 Release - Kinto now includes a system tray and simple wizard to setup the install with minimal effort.

Kinto is powered by [xkeysnail](https://github.com/mooz/xkeysnail) for Linux.

Note: VNC is now experimentally supported on Linux w/ the latest releases, but you must compile & install x11vnc. More info can be [found here](https://gist.github.com/rbreaves/87059f92f030ee4e068f911ddb56a4dd).

~~Note: If you plan to remote into Linux via VNC, xRDP, Synergy or other remote desktop solutions then remove the current release & try an earlier [v1.0.7-3](https://github.com/rbreaves/kinto/releases/tag/1.0.7-3) release. It uses xkb so it'll work with virtual xinput devices. Some v1.1-x releases may offer both, but all v1.2.x releases ended support for xkb. I do plan to bring offical support back for virtual input devices.~~

### Quick Install Method

Paste the following into your Terminal
```
/bin/bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbreaves/kinto/HEAD/install/linux.sh || curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbreaves/kinto/HEAD/install/linux.sh)"
```

Uninstall
```
/bin/bash <( wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbreaves/kinto/HEAD/install/linux.sh || curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbreaves/kinto/HEAD/install/linux.sh ) -r
```

### Old Install Method

```
git clone https://github.com/rbreaves/kinto.git
cd kinto
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
./setup.py
```

**Troubleshoot**

If the wizard does not appear then either type in "kinto.sh" in your application overview search bar or run this following command.
```
~/.config/kinto/gui/kinto-gui.py
```

**Uninstall Kinto**

```
./setup.py -r
```

**Other tips**

If you want a global menu app similar to what mac users have then I strongly recommend Ubuntu Budgie as it has the Vala Appmenu built in and ready for activation. Short of that Vala-AppMenu can be installed in various distros, mileage will vary. If you try to activate it in the latest 20.xx releases with XFCE then you may need to run the following commands.

```
sudo apt install xfce4-appmenu-plugin vala-panel-appmenu-common appmenu-gtk2-module appmenu-gtk3-module appmenu-gtk-module-common
xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Gtk/Modules -n -t string -s "appmenu-gtk-module"
```

## What does this do exactly?

Kinto works for standard Windows, Apple and Chromebook keyboards. The following however describes the dynamic rebinding based on a standard Windows/Mac keyboard.

- Cursor/word-wise shortcut keys have been added to align with macOS keyboard shortcuts.

**GUI**
|**Physical**| Ctrl  |  Win/Alt |  Alt/Cmd | Spacebar|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Virtual**|  Win/Super* | Alt  |  RCtrl |Spacebar|

*Win/Super will properly remap to LCtrl when needed to fully support expected keymaps.

**Terminal**
|**Physical**| Ctrl  |  Win/Alt |  Alt/Cmd | Spacebar|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Virtual**|  LCtrl | Alt  |  RCtrl |Spacebar|

Note: RCtrl for terminals is also adding in Shift most of the time, however it depends on the specific terminal in use and will change itself to the expected keymaps of that terminal application.

## What's different?

Compared to most other remappers ***this is a complete system-wide remap of your base level modifier keys***, this saves time. You're not going to die a death of a thousand papercuts from trying to support every shortcut key under the sun.

It also retains some of the most commonly used system level shortcut keys, such as Cmd-C/V, Cmd-Tab, and Ctrl-Tab among others. You will keep seamless copy & paste between all apps, ability to switch Windows while still using the physical Cmd/Alt key position; switch tabs in your favorite terminals, code editors, or web browsers. Depending on your OS and/or Desktop Environment you may also be able to switch Virtual Desktop environments the same way as well and other basic system level shortcuts.

If your OS and macOS have similar functionality on the system level, but only differ by a slight difference of a shortcut command then Kinto likely supports it already. If Kinto doesn't have what you need then you can open up a support ticket and it will be added. You can also fork the project to add the fix and I will merge it via a PR you make.

Additionally, if you are using a cross-platform app and if it happens to have a few shortcut keys that differ then that can very easily be added to either the kinto.py or kinto.ahk configuration files which on Windows is located here `~/.kinto/kinto.ahk` and on Linux it can be found here `~/.config/kinto/kinto.py`. More info can be found here [Shortcut Creation](#Shortcut-Creation)

## What does Kinto require?

- Python
- systemd or sysvinit
- x11
- xkeysnail

### Kinto for Windows 10 Requirements

- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- Powershell - run as Administrator
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

Other programs that will be installed when you run ./setup.py
- Chocolatey
- Autohotkey
- Strawberry Perl

Note: Sublime Text users should disable screen rotation hotkeys as they will interfere with multi-cursor and possibly other combos. See https://windowsloop.com/disable-screen-rotation-keyboard-shortcut/ for details.

You may also want to disable the Xbox Game Bar so that Win+G or other shortcuts will not interfere with any of your remaps. Start menu -> Game bar shortcuts -> toggle Off.

## Shortcut Creation

[Linux Shortcut Creation (Xkeysnail)](#Linux-Xkeysnail)

[Windows Shortcut Creation (Autohotkey)](#Windows-Autohotkey)


## Linux (Xkeysnail)

**GUI Keys**
| Value| Description|Mac/Kinto Equivalent|
| ----- |:--------:|:--------:|
|C,Ctrl|Control|Cmd|
|M,Alt| Alt/Option|Alt/Option|
|Super | Win/Super|Ctrl|

**Terminal Keys**
| Value| Description|Mac/Kinto Equivalent|
| ----- |:--------:|:--------:|
|RC,RCtrl|Right Control â†’ Left & Right Alt/Cmd key|Cmd|
|M,Alt|Alt/Option|Alt/Option|
|LC,LCtrl |Left Control|Ctrl|

You can define new keymaps for your specific app via this method. You also do not have to cancel out the original keybinding if you do not need or want to, but you can do so with "pass_through_key".

### Defining Keymaps Per App
```
# Keybindings for Sublime Text
define_keymap(re.compile("Sublime_text"),{
    K("C-h"): pass_through_key,          # cancel replace
    K("Ctrl-Alt-f"): K("Ctrl-h"),        # replace
    K("C-M-v"): [K("C-k"), K("C-v")],    # paste_from_history
}
```

In the above example I am also showing that you can define a single shortcut to enact multiple shortcut keys if needed by defining an array of shortcuts to trigger.

To make changes you can edit ~/.config/kinto/kinto.py under linux & restart the xkeysnail service via the system tray, app or CLI.

systemd
```
sudo systemctl restart xkeysnail
```

sysvinit
```
sudo -E /etc/init.d/kinto restart
```

More information can be seen on the readme page of [xkeysnail](https://github.com/mooz/xkeysnail).

## How to Upgrade Kinto

Simply bring down the latest then you can re-run the setup.py installer, it will stop the service and re-install Kinto.

Note: If you have made any custom changes to ~/.config/kinto then you will need to backup or rename those directories before running an update.

```
git pull origin master
./setup.py
```

## How to Control Kinto

This info is now superceded by the fact that linux has a full fledge GUI and system tray app that is very easy to use, but I will keep the command line options for those that want to know what they are.

Status

systemd
```
sudo systemctl status xkeysnail
```

sysvinit
```
tail -f /tmp/kinto.log
```

Stop (your keymap will return to normal)

systemd
```
sudo systemctl stop xkeysnail
```

sysvinit
```
sudo -E /etc/init.d/kinto stop
```

Start

systemd
```
sudo systemctl start xkeysnail
```

sysvinit
```
sudo -E /etc/init.d/kinto start
```

Restart

systemd
```
sudo systemctl restart xkeysnail
```

sysvinit
```
sudo -E /etc/init.d/kinto restart
```


### Does not start when you log in or after you reboot?

You may need to manually set your DISPLAY in the systemd service file. Normally it pulls in the proper DISPLAY value but if it doesn't you can try this.

Another possibility is the SELinux could be enabled and needs to be set to permissive. (aka /etc/selinux/config)

To reset the display variable

```
echo $DISPLAY

# :0.0
```

You can use the Kinto.sh app or system tray to edit your service file.

kinto.sh gui
1. Edit -> Edit Service
kinto tray
1. Customize -> Edit Service

or you can use your terminal.

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/xkeysnail.service
```
...
[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
Environment=DISPLAY=:0.0
...
```

If you continue to have issues then open a ticket and send me the info.

The best Terminal app built for Windows hands down. I have tried countless, but this one actually seems to get everything right, despite the lack of a GUI to configure all aspects of the program. Custom configurations have to be done via a json file - but given the performance and feature set I feel like it is a decent trade off.

I will update Kinto to have custom configurations for this specific Terminal in the future. Will make seamless copy & paste, which already works, work even better (Cmd-C can still trigger sigint - but there is a fix for that that involves updating the json config).

## Credits and Contributions

I would just like to thank a few people here directly that have helped me tremendously with completing this project and without their support, direct, indirect or otherwise I would have had difficulty completing this undertaking. I will list these things off in chronological order mostly.

First off I'd like to thank the Stackoverflow and Stackexchange community. I have probably rubbed some mods the wrong way over there, but the people from the community in general are extremely helpful and gracious and without their contributions would have made this much more difficult. The person I'd like to thank most though from over there is Glen Whitney. Without his detailed explaining of how to rebind keys in xkb this would not have come together at all, as every other remapping solution were non-starters as complexity increases. *Kinto today no longer uses xkb, but Glen Whitney did provide the basis of a workable method that helped me pursue this method and think it was a worthwhile project to pursue, so for that I thank him.*

Secondarily I'd like to thank Christian Eriksson*, as he provided information that kept me up at night.. literally. Even after I implemented a similar bash script to one he had suggested I knew that fully implementing a c/c++ solution was where Kinto needed to head to and his explanation was better than I remember it being now that I have gone back to read it again. He also never provided a full implementation of a c/c++ solution - he did hit on the pain points pretty well of what one would need to do and watch out for. I am not sure where I got the first example code of implementing a c based solution, but he definitely went over it well.


Kui and his gist file** was really the c based solution that I found had the fewest issues to resolve to making it a reliable solution. It didn't account for all failures very well, aka BadWindow issues, but it made for a great foundation on which Kintox11 is built. I cannot thank him enough for putting it out there for others to work with.

Lastly these four people were also very helpful to me as well. @probonopd for being one of the first people to install and use Kinto and gave me the initial feedback to include wordwise support! He also has really great articles*** posted on HackerNews & Medium about UI/UX design. Another person I'd like to thank is @owzim, his feedback allowed me to rapidly iterate and fix several bugs to support additional platforms better. The last two are members of the #ubuntu channel in IRC on freenode, tarzeau ( @alexmyczko ) and sarnold. Alex contributing a proper Makefile, so the project can be packaged properly, and sarnold help me find that IBus could resolve an issue I was having with needing to detect the caret status.

**Updated 6/13/2020**

I would also like to thank Jonathan Chun for his patience in helping me work through a very difficult problem related to Alt-Tab switching, which led to the current xkeysnail iteration of Kinto for Linux that far exceeds the original xkb implementation. There are also several others that have created issue tickets that have contributed greatly.
